# Advent of Code 2020

Started AOC in 2019, but only made it to roughly day 11 or 12 at the time because had been busy with new job and 
school. This year I.... don't really have that much more time but thought I'd try again. I do better with competition,
what can I say? 

Anndddd it turns out I _do_ do better with a little competition, because I'm done with all 25 days and on time on
Christmas! I now have a tshirt and sticker on the way because I feel (justifiably) pretty proud. 

# Small things I've learned

- learned to lean more heavily into functools. i really like sum(list), so reduce(func, list) is increeddddddibly
handy. i don't really do a whole of map for these problems, but maybe i should.
- in an offshoot to that, I did the equivalent of product(list) using reduce(mul, list) but then got tired of 
importing mul so ended up using more lambdas
- got better at fancier lambdas. especially with cool groupbys in pandas
- learned to abstract into higher dimensions with the conway cubes problem. I had read this math overflow thread
quite recently - https://mathoverflow.net/questions/25983/intuitive-crutches-for-higher-dimensional-thinking - and
had been kind of lost as to how to use some of these mental shortcuts. had been thinking i could do it, somehow, via
matrices and this problem helped a looottttt with that mental path.
- discovered pow() has a built in modulus in it? very nifty!
